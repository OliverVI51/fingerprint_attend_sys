# 📌 Arduino-Based Fingerprint Attendance System

This project is an **automated attendance system** using an **Arduino microcontroller** and a **fingerprint sensor** to identify individuals and log attendance securely and efficiently. Designed for use in schools, offices, or restricted areas, it eliminates the need for manual attendance tracking and prevents proxy attendance.

## 📁 Project Structure


---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open the main `.ino` file in Arduino IDE
3. Upload the code to your Arduino board
4. Use the serial monitor or LCD interface to enroll and verify fingerprints
5. Attendance logs will be shown or stored (based on your setup)

## 🔒 Security Considerations

- Fingerprints are stored with unique IDs
- Prevents duplicate or unauthorized access
- Hardware-level validation ensures accuracy
